# Background / Goal
Project started with learning to create an application to modify my notes that are
stored in Github as markdown and same time create homepage for myself. Idea was to
basically copy functionality what Github already offers and learning to use few selected
technologies better. The editing of articles is suppose to support up to one thousand users
editing same time by leveraging signal-r communication that is extended to support multiple
host front end nodes with Redis.

This has turned now to become a simple news downloader (News microservice). So currently
It download all YLE news articles as they release them, convert them little bit into simple
markdown article format. Then NewsAnalyze microservice feeds them to Mistral AI model
running with llama.cpp for classification. I am running the models with my Nvidia
GTX 3060 & 3080 gaming cards.

Idea is to just classify articles so I can browse only positive news :)
- [Positive news sit is up and running](https://news.anttieskola.com/)

Other thing I am currently working is to write very good instructions for model to
mimic myself. It seems to be really fun to interract this way. Maybe I get the instructions
good enough that I can use models with instructions to write some job applications.
Currently instructions only make AI to know about myself, family and my work history.
It is not ready for writing job applications or selecting jobs I want to apply for.

After I learn to create good enough instructions I want to learn to fine-tune models
and start creating a data-set to use in fine-tuning these awesome open source models.

- [Antai, Antti AI chat is up and running](https://antai.anttieskola.com/)
	- Currently behind username and password for myself and family to test it out

Public site is not currently deployed, not sure what content to add into it.
Currently [main site](https://www.anttieskola.com) is just html page with link to news site.

## Current todo list

### Architecture
- Someway to not need to make dummies for components that don't require or where I want no
access to AI. MediatR is missing support for this and will not get it (has been asked from author)

### News
- Statistic from the news, I want to see graph showing me for many positive news articles
are released daily. Vision to see history graph and some way to dig thru the graph aswell
into actual articles
- Yle published same article in different languages, examine can AI determine that they are
same article. We only need to check for same articles during some time window like 24 hours.
- Create Eduskunta RSS feed downloader and analyzer
- Buy subscriptions to Helsinki Sanomat, Kaleva, Kauppalehti, YCombinator... any that
  provide RSS feeds or similar ways to track new articles
- Create microservice that inspects articles using AI to detect failty ones, then try
to repair them: redownload content, try to parse again?...

### Antai
- Ability to modify all content in context (AI replies and own answers)
- Add property for chat to have a title, title can be generated by AI using new "model"
and based upon the first interaction with the chat
- Chat list page to list all existing chats (title would be nice for this as only ID and lenght can be shown...)
- Chat's are all stored only in Redis atm, I want a microservice that writes them into
database

### Far fetched ideas
- Persons in news articles (are kinda tagged), offer possibility to ask AI to explain about them
	- Offer wikipedia link about them
- Create network of AI models
	- I would run multiple different models on n-number of hosts
	- Run prompts on each simultaneously and then combine results

# Code architecture
All is done using clean architecture / "domain based" programming. Most of all I want to
thank [Jason Taylor](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture) for really great
template from which I have copied most of structure for this project.

Using Command/Query separation pattern with [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR).
Even my domain has dependency on MediatR as it is essential for the architecture.

MediatR has serious flaw that it is impossible to select which handlers you want to register
this has lead me to write dummies into web application that I don't want any direct use to
my GPU's. I might have to fork/modify MediaRT to support selecting specific handlers a good
idea I found on forums is to use attributes. Current author is not interested at all to allow
any kind of shenanigans like this. He will reject any propositions.

## Libraries
- Domain the "holy grail"
	- This has dependency on MediaRt & Dependency injection to be able to use the command &
	query architecture
	- ***No other dependencies should be added***
- Application higher level implementations... kinda empty still as many things implemented
features are placed currently in the component that is kinda wrong way and should be fixed
- Infra, folder that contains shared infrastructure implementations
	- AI api to llama server running models
	- Redis our shared data storage and messaging
- Each component should have their own infrastructure library when they need (database as an example)
# Components
Each component is true microservice so they work on their own. What they do share is
Redis so that data is shared between them, but note that ***Redis data is not permanent*** and
components need to be able to build up Redis data from scratch. Communication between components
happens using events send in Redis channels.

List of current components and used software
- Microservices
	- [NewsDownloader](./doc/NewsDownloader.md) Downloads news from internet, convert and store them into Redis
	- [NewsAnalyzer](./doc/NewsAnalyzer.md) Classifies news articles with large language models
- [Ui.Public](./doc/UiPublic.md) User interface for the application
	- Using server rendered blazor as I want to learn to use it better and I think it is
	fits my needs best
- [Ui.News](./doc/todo.md) Currently optimized for news reading, development in progress
- Ui.NewsWA is just a test to write same app using WebAssembly but this will need WebAPI project too
	- Having issues that can't debug it properly and not sure are lifecycle methods triggering
- [Ui.Antai](./doc/antai.md) UI for chat with me feature
- [Ui.PromptStudio](./doc/UiPromptstudio.md) UI for creating and testing AI system instructions

	- Only run server locally and on-demand only
- Postgresql is installed using their apt package repository

Could someday learn to create docker containers and make one for each component.

## Folder paths
- `/var/aje/yle` is used to store raw YLE news downloads
- `/var/aje/ai` is used to dump AI model input & outputs that require inspection

## Databases (postgresql)
- [installation](https://wiki.debian.org/PostgreSql)

## Systemd
- Each component is their own service
- Service installation instructions are found in [service definition](./aje.service)
	- [Debian systemd](https://wiki.debian.org/systemd/Services)
	- Running as my normal user for now

## Nginx configuration
- [Documentation](./doc/nginx.md)
- Asp.net process is running in ports
	- Ui.Public 5001
	- Ui.News 5002
	- Ui.Antai 5003
- [WebSocket documentation](https://www.nginx.com/blog/websocket-nginx/)
- TODO: Need separate certificate for news.anttieskola.com
- TODO: How to configure server to support both sites

## Backup
Folder `backup` contains scripts to create backup files from database, raw yle news
, ai model inspection reports and complete Redis installation.

These are saved in my onedrive.
