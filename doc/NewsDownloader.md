# News - microservice

Simple microservice that's purpose is to download news articles from the internet and convert them to AJE Article format which is just collection of markdown elements.

All raw data is saved in plain files currently as it just works and can fully reload all data from scratch.

# JsonPath
- [Following the thread](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/31068)
- Not going remake all with newtonsoft anymore
- Was promised to 8.0 but did not deliver
- Is promised to maybe be in 9.0
- People already made few libraries on their own, maybe they can copy best to platform :D
- Sticking to minimal dependencies plan!

# Tool
- [json2csharp](https://json2csharp.com/)
    - Can create model files from json data
    - Might be easier to make parsing but more prone to updates -> errors
