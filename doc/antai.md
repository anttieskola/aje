# UI
- Basic functionality is there

## Small issues
- Focus works to new inputs and that also scrolls view to the point
    - But at the bottom when answer is been written is out of view
- Interaction component could share inputs from all clients
    - Also the model output should be send to all clients
    - Already works otherwise as clients refresh chat history when
    new entry is added

## Bad responses

# Backend
- Need to update system instructions to reflect freshly created CV's and applications
- Need to add tokenizer api into use and token calculation to track history size and calculate limits
- There is now available 4060 GTX with 16GB RAM [Verkkokauppa](https://www.verkkokauppa.com/fi/product/886417/MSI-GeForce-RTX-4060-Ti-VENTUS-3X-16G-OC-naytonohjain) this would allow larger context size
    - Could always use heavier quantization to reduce memory usage
